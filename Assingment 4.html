     <li>1 tablespoon olive Oil </li>
     <li>1 teaspoon ginger garlic paste </li>

        8 to 10 whole cashews,
        2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 
        1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste,
        1 teaspoon sugar,
        1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes,
        2 tablespoons dried coriander,
        1 1/2 teaspoons ground garam masala,
        1/2 teaspoon ground Kashmiri Lal Mirch,
        1/2 teaspoon salt,

 <h2><b>Recipe:</b></h2>
 <p>Chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chili, salt, garam masala and ginger garlic paste.

    The marinated chicken is cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato- and garlic and ginger-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala and fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cream may be used in the sauce or as a garnish. Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and it is finally garnished with coriander.</p>
